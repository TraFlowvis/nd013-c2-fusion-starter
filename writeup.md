# Writeup Midterm

## Step 1 Part 2 PointCould findings

#### __Find and display 6 examples of vehicles with varying degrees of visibility in the point-cloud__

Vehicle 1

#### __Identify vehicle features that appear as a stable feature on most vehicles (e.g. rear-bumper, tail-lights) and describe them briefly. Also, use the range image viewer from the last example to underpin your findings using the lidar intensity channel.__
- Height, depth and width of the vehicle can be used for the cassification (keeping diffent vehicle types in mind)
- wheels can often be identified if the view sees a bit of the carside
- often smaller gradient in heigt on the front of the car (windschield and )


# Writeup: Track 3D-Objects Over Time

Please use this starter template to answer the following questions:

### 1. Write a short recap of the four tracking steps and what you implemented there (filter, track management, association, camera fusion). Which results did you achieve? Which part of the project was most difficult for you to complete, and why?


### 2. Do you see any benefits in camera-lidar fusion compared to lidar-only tracking (in theory and in your concrete results)? 


### 3. Which challenges will a sensor fusion system face in real-life scenarios? Did you see any of these challenges in the project?


### 4. Can you think of ways to improve your tracking results in the future?
